Anyways, it's hard out here making a name for oneself, but she wrangled an opportunity to be a host for a PBS pilot and it just came out today and it is just so wonderful to see her succeeding despite all the consternation, opposition, anxiety and doubt that she works through to do this kinda shit. She's worked so hard and come so far but I think this is one of the first times her successes actually broke through all that and hit her in the face, like this is her *job* to be an awesome person and there's just no better validation than that. Anyways, peace and love to anyone who reads my rant lol",1

EDIT SO I WALK INTO MY OFFICE FOR THE DEFENSE AND MY WIFE IS HERE TO SURPRISE ME!!!! LET'S GO!!!! ONE MORE HOUR! Edit Edit OMG! This is be far my most upvoted post. Okay...first I PASSED! You can call me Doctor! Second, my inbox is blown up; I will get back to EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU eventually, but please give me time! Edit Edit Edit I'd like to add one more thing many people have commented about wanting to quit something meaningful to them. This is a very normal experience to have. I almost quit my program at least 10 times in the first year because I did not believe I could do it. Just know that you can do it, but it is going to require some pains along the way. Anyone is welcome to PM me ANY TIME if they need someone for moral support. Thanks for the support, and have a great day!",1

2023-09-27T06:06:34.770231Z,Compliments I usually have a hard time taking compliments. I've never been good at it and I'm pretty modest for the most part. I have been dating someone for about 5 years and their mom gave me a compliment today that made me cry. It wasn't about how I looked but who I am as a person. She said  I was shocked. I don't receive many compliments other than from my partner and this one just felt so genuine. She said that she is so happy that I'm dating her child and no matter what happens i will always be apart of their family. My family life isn't great so it was a double whammy for me. I've never had someone be happy just for me existing and being myself. She also acknowledged how hard I work in college and not letting anything stop me. I was speechless to be honest. I didn't know what to say. I still don't know what to say. It's hard to accept it,0
